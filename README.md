# Parallax

Deployed Page:
https://jschneid94.github.io/Parallax/

This is my most recent portfolio page. Having done my previous portfolio pages using vanilla CSS and Bootstrap, I wanted to try something new with this page and hopefully develop something more "employer competitve."

This page was designed using the Materialize library by Google; this library is fairly similar to Bootstrap but has a built in parallax feature. Some additional libraries I used were the MD Bootstrap and FontAwesome libraries.
